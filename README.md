==========

Slides generator with backend to add CRUD functionality to your slides.

You can see a better description on the URL of the hackathon (yes, that was made in a weekend!): http://paylogic.github.com/winter-hackathon/ (the project name there is "Slides Generator").

Here you can find a really crappy `pow(alpha, 2)`: http://nameless-spire-1402.herokuapp.com/.


TODO
----

* Add new presentation
* Resize text properly on the editor
* Click on the slide on the editor will center it on the screen instead force you to scroll
* Some stylism
* Get the fonts directly from API instead hardcode them
* Change the viewer to something own, really simple:
    * slide keeping the ratio
    * max height possible, with minimal padding on top and bottom
    * some simple slide change effect
    * ...
* Get a domain
* Perhaps allows the users to render with != JS sliders: impressjs, reveal, FullscreenSlitSlider...
* **All what you want!** *Disclaimer: If you provide the proper pull request*.
